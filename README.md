## About
Hey, y'all, this website is not only the cummulation of what I have learned at [Nashville Software School](https://github.com/nashville-software-school), but also a long-term project that's eventually going to be a live mobile app (hpefully on one or more app stores).

As I was beginning the brainstorming phase of what I wanted to do for my backend capstone, one of my friends called me and asked for my help in finding her dog that had gotten out of her fenced-in backyard. She said she had posted on multiple platforms to help with the cause, but it did not seem fruitful.

I then did some research (I googled) and found that there really aren't many good resources for helping owners find their lost pets. Thus, Find Your Buddy was born.

As the owner of an escape artist cat, I am well aware of the stress and anxiety that comes from losing your best friend, and Find Your Buddy(FYB) is designed to help with that.

In it's infancy, FYB will be a basic CRUD posting app where users can post about their lost pet, or about a pet they have found that the owner may not know is lost yet. Over time, new features will expand the project to include notifications and other cool things.
